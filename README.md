      <p>I grew up as eldest daughter, and being the eldest is not easy because this position in the family comes with great responsibility. You are expected to do most of the household chores and take over your parents' responsibilities when they are not at home, which is why I never really felt what it was like to have a proper childhood. Their expectations of me were high because I am the eldest, and even with the smallest mistakes, I would be the one scolded and disciplined. That’s why I strive to be better and independent, relying only on myself.

      <p>Despite being the eldest, it never stops me from being who I am. Even though I face so much challenges but when I think my goal, it gives me hope that life is just a cycle, if you can't keep going then you don't have any plan to grow and feel your victories you've been through so much to achieve the real results of your works.</p>
